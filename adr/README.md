# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the `dg-sqlmesh` project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, rationale, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide:

- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen over alternatives
- **Consequences**: Both positive and negative outcomes

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Individual Asset Pattern

Each SQLMesh model becomes a separate Dagster asset, enabling granular control and better UI integration.

### 2. Shared Execution Pattern

Single SQLMesh execution per Dagster run, shared between all selected assets to respect SQLMesh's natural dependency management.

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

Custom SQLMesh console captures execution events and converts them to Dagster concepts (asset checks, error messages, etc.).

### 4. Resource-Based State Management

`SQLMeshResultsResource` manages shared state between assets in the same run, ensuring consistency.

### 5. Tag-Based Property Mapping

`dagster:property_name:value` convention allows SQLMesh models to override Dagster asset properties via tags.

### 6. Version Mapping Strategy

SQLMesh `data_hash` maps to Dagster `code_version`, SQLMesh snapshot version maps to Dagster `data_version` for accurate sync status.

### 7. Plan/Run Flow and Separation of Concerns

Use SQLMesh `plan` for metadata extraction and `run` for materialization. Our module is a materialization orchestrator, not a workflow manager - we don't handle environments, breaking changes, or plan validation.

### 8. Shared State Management Pattern

`SQLMeshResultsResource` manages shared state between assets in the same run, ensuring single SQLMesh execution per run while maintaining proper isolation between different runs.

### 9. Function Extraction and Modularity

Large functions are broken down into smaller, focused utility functions to improve maintainability, testability, and readability while maintaining external API compatibility.

### 10. Layered Error Handling Strategy

Custom exception classes and error classification system that distinguishes between different error types and handles them appropriately without breaking the entire pipeline.

### 11. Declarative Component Configuration

SQLMesh Dagster Component provides declarative YAML configuration for SQLMesh projects, following dagster-dbt patterns with Jinja2 templating for external asset mapping and smart default values for improved user experience.

## Current Limitations

### Non-Blocking Audits

SQLMesh supports non-blocking audits, but current implementation only handles blocking audits. Future enhancement needed.

### Schedule Complexity

Adaptive schedules based on SQLMesh crons require complex logic to determine optimal execution frequency.

### Error Type Distinction

Distinguishing between transient and persistent failures for retry logic is complex and not fully implemented.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Non-blocking audit support** - Handle SQLMesh non-blocking audits in Dagster
2. **Enhanced error classification** - Better distinction between transient and persistent failures
3. **Advanced scheduling** - More sophisticated adaptive scheduling based on data dependencies
4. **Performance optimization** - Reduce memory usage and improve execution speed

## Contributing

When making significant architectural changes:

1. **Create a new ADR** following the template
2. **Update existing ADRs** if decisions change
3. **Link related ADRs** to show dependencies
4. **Include diagrams** using Mermaid for complex flows
5. **Document consequences** both positive and negative
