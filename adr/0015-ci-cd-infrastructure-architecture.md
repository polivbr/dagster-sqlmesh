# ADR-015: CI/CD Infrastructure Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The dg-sqlmesh project requires a robust, automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and reliable releases. As an open-source project, we need to leverage GitHub's free infrastructure while maintaining professional standards for testing, security scanning, and automated releases.

## Decision

We implement a comprehensive CI/CD architecture using GitHub Actions with three main workflows:

### 1. Test & Quality Workflow (`test.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push to any branch, Pull Requests
**Matrix:** Python 3.11, 3.12 on Ubuntu Latest
**Steps:**

- Code quality: Ruff linting and formatting
- Dead code detection: Vulture analysis
- Dependency installation and version consistency checks
- Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting
- Coverage upload to Codecov for tracking

### 2. Security Workflow (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:** Weekly schedule, manual dispatch, security events
**Security Scans:**

- `pip-audit`: Python package vulnerability scanning
- `safety`: Additional security vulnerability detection
- `pip-licenses`: License compliance verification
- Dependency security analysis

### 3. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:** Git tag push (v\*), manual dispatch
**Release Process:**

- Automated package building with `uv`
- PyPI publication using secure API tokens
- GitHub Release creation with changelog
- Artifact publication and distribution

## Architecture Principles

### Quality Gates

- **100% Test Success Required**: No compromises on test failures
- **Linting Enforcement**: Ruff formatting and style checks mandatory
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Coverage Tracking**: Code coverage monitoring and reporting

### Security-First Approach

- **Secrets Management**: PyPI tokens stored as GitHub secrets
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **License Compliance**: Automated license verification
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static security analysis enabled

### Automation & DX (Developer Experience)

- **Dependabot Integration**: Automated dependency updates
- **Issue Templates**: Structured bug reports and feature requests
- **PR Templates**: Comprehensive review checklist
- **Release Helper**: Interactive release script for version management

```

### Key Technologies

- **GitHub Actions**: Free CI/CD for open-source
- **uv**: Fast Python package management
- **Ruff**: Lightning-fast Python linting and formatting
- **Vulture**: Dead code detection
- **pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework
- **Coverage**: Code coverage analysis
- **Codecov**: Coverage reporting and tracking

### Test Architecture Innovations

Our CI/CD includes sophisticated integration tests for SQLMesh audit systems:

#### Blocking vs Non-Blocking Audit Testing

- **Non-blocking audits**: Use `_non_blocking` suffix convention
- **Blocking audits**: Standard audit names
- **Test isolation**: Separate SQLMesh models for different audit types
- **Data corruption testing**: Controlled corruption with `restate-models` + date ranges

#### Critical Test Patterns

```python
# Non-blocking: audit_blocking=False, severity=WARN
not_constant_non_blocking(column := supply_name)

# Blocking: audit_blocking=True, severity=ERROR
not_constant(column := store_id)
```

## Dependencies and Tools

### Development Dependencies Added

```toml
[dependency-groups.dev]
coverage[toml] = ">=7.0.0"      # Code coverage with TOML support
pip-audit = ">=2.9.0"          # Security vulnerability scanning
safety = ">=3.6.0"             # Additional security checks
pip-licenses = ">=5.0.0"       # License compliance verification
ruff = ">=0.12.10"             # Updated linting and formatting
```

### Makefile Integration

```makefile
coverage:          # Run tests with coverage reporting
security:          # Run security scans (pip-audit, safety, licenses)
ci-test:          # Simulate CI workflow locally
pre-commit:       # Local quality checks before commit
release-*:        # Interactive release helpers
```

## Benefits

### For Developers

- **Fast Feedback**: Quick CI runs with parallel execution
- **Local Testing**: `make ci-test` simulates full CI locally
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated code quality enforcement
- **Security**: Proactive vulnerability detection

### For Project Maintenance

- **Automated Releases**: Zero-manual-effort publishing
- **Dependency Management**: Automated updates with Dependabot
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive templates and processes
- **Monitoring**: Coverage and security tracking

### For Users

- **Reliability**: 100% test coverage requirement
- **Security**: Regular security scanning and updates
- **Transparency**: Open CI/CD processes and results
- **Quality**: Professional-grade code standards

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Test Architecture

Our CI/CD includes breakthrough integration testing for SQLMesh audit systems:

1. **Isolated Models**: Separate SQLMesh models for blocking (`stg_stores`) and non-blocking (`stg_supplies`) audits
2. **Controlled Corruption**: Data corruption after `sqlmesh.context.plan()` but before execution
3. **Restate Strategy**: Use `--restate-model` with date ranges to force re-evaluation
4. **Plan Failure = Success**: For blocking audits, plan failure indicates correct behavior

### Critical Fixes Implemented

- **Metadata Preservation**: Asset check metadata preserved for correct blocking status
- **Notifier State Management**: Proper `clear_notifier_state()` timing to prevent cross-test contamination
- **Blocking Status Detection**: Direct SQLMesh ModelAudit object querying for authoritative status

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Professional Quality**: CI/CD infrastructure matches enterprise standards
- **Developer Confidence**: Comprehensive testing prevents regressions
- **Security Assurance**: Proactive vulnerability management
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Automated processes reduce manual overhead
- **Community Trust**: Transparent, reliable development process

### Trade-offs

- **CI Time**: Comprehensive testing takes 10-15 minutes per run
- **Complexity**: Multi-workflow setup requires understanding for maintenance
- **Dependency Management**: More dependencies require security monitoring

## Future Considerations

- **Performance Optimization**: Potential for faster CI runs through caching
- **Additional Security**: Consider SAST/DAST scanning for enhanced security
- **Release Automation**: Potential for automatic changelog generation
- **Monitoring**: Consider adding performance benchmarking to CI

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All workflows implemented and functioning
✅ **154 Tests Passing** - 100% success rate achieved
✅ **Security Scanning** - Active vulnerability monitoring
✅ **Automated Releases** - Production-ready release pipeline
